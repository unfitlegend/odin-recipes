<h2>You can have this lightly sweetened, tender, and flaky baked salmon for dinner in under 25 minutes!</h2>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar, tightly packed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>4 (8-ounce) skin-on salmon filets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>

<li><p><h2>Preheat the oven to 425°F.</h2></p>
<p>Position a rack in the center, line a sheet pan with foil, and set it aside.</p></li>

<li><p><h2>Prepare the glaze:</h2></p>
<p>In a small bowl, stir the brown sugar, mustard, honey, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes until 
smooth and drizzly.</p></li>

<li><p><h2>Dry and glaze the salmon:</h2></p>
<p>If you like to eat the salmon skin, pat it very, very dry with a clean dish towel or paper towels. 
Skip this step if you prefer not to eat the skin. </p>
<p>Place the filets, skin side-down and with space between each filet, on the prepared sheet pan.</p>
<p>Spoon the glaze onto the filets, making sure it fully covers the tops. Use the back of the spoon to spread it out.</p></li>

<li><p><h2>Bake and serve:</h2></p>
<p>Bake until the tops are golden brown and crispy in spots. 
The salmon will feel slightly firm when pressed with your fingers and it should flake easily with a fork, 12 to 14 minutes. 
If your filets are thin (less than an inch thick), start checking for doneness at the 10-minute mark. 
A digital thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the salmon should register between 
125°F and 130°F—this is considered cooked medium.</p>
<p>Use a spatula to transfer the salmon onto plates and serve warm.</p>
<p>Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 4 days. 
To reheat, place it on a foil-lined sheet pan and bake it slowly at 300°F until warmed through. 
This low and slow method will prevent the salmon from drying out too much.</p></li>
