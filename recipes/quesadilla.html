<h2><p>Shrimp quesadilla! Flour tortillas toasted with shredded Monterey Jack cheese and pan-seared shrimp with onions, 
cilantro, avocados</p></h2>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>1/4 pound of medium-small raw shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon chipotle powder</li>
<li>Pinch salt</li>
<li>Pinch ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 tablespoon lime or lemon juice</li>
<li>2 1/2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil (divided, 2 teaspoons and 1/2 teaspoon)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped red onion</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>2 medium flour tortillas</li>
<li>1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
<li>1/4 avocado, sliced</li>
<li>Dollop sour cream or crema fresca</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><h2>Marinate the shrimp:</h2></p>
<p>Toss the shrimp in a small bowl with 1/4 teaspoon of chipotle powder or chile powder, a pinch of salt, pinch of pepper, 
and a tablespoon of lime or lemon juice. Let sit for 10 minutes. Then drain out the juice.</p></li>

<li><p><h2>Cook the shrimp:</h2></p>
<p>Heat a couple teaspoons of olive oil in a relatively stick-free skillet (a cast iron skillet works well for this) 
on medium high heat.</p>
<p>Add the shrimp and cook for half a minute on each side, and remove to a bowl.</p>
<p>The shrimp shouldn't be completely cooked through; they will continue to cook during the next step.</p></li>

<li><p><h2>Heat the tortillas:</h2></p>
<p>Wipe out the skillet with paper towels. Add a small amount of olive oil (about 1/2 a teaspoon, 
you could use butter as well) and heat the pan on medium high.</p>
<p>Place one flour tortilla on the skillet. Flip the tortilla over a few times, 10 seconds between flips. 
Air pockets should begin to form within the tortilla.</p>
<p>Remove the tortilla and repeat with the second tortilla. 
Leave the second tortilla in the pan and reduce the heat to medium.</p></li>

<li><p><h2>Build the quesadilla:</h2></p>
<p>Sprinkle the tortilla with the grated cheese. Distribute the shrimp on top of the cheese. 
Add chopped onion and cilantro. Place the other tortilla on top.</p>
<p>Flip the quesadilla over when the bottom tortilla is nicely toasted and the cheese has begun to melt. 
Remove the quesadilla from the pan when the now bottom tortilla has toasted sufficiently.</p>
<p>You can also use just one tortilla instead of two, and fold the tortilla over itself like an omelette.</p></li>

<li><p><h2>Cut the quesadilla into triangles:</h2></p>
<p>Cut like a pie into six pieces (a pizza wheel works well for this). Place on a serving plate. 
Serve with avocado slices and sour cream. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro. 
Squeeze a little lime juice over everything.</p></li>
